# OpenAPI Generator Ignore
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# Do not overwrite entry point
main.go

# Do not overwrite dependency definitions in go.mod
go.mod

# Do not overwrite API implementation files
# api_<NAME>.go files map the request to the service invocation; we generally modify these to pass through
# status codes for errors, which is not handled in the initially generated code.
# api_<NAME>_service.go files contain the business logic implementation for our APIs.
# api.go contains interface definitions, which we generally modify to return status codes for errors, which is not
# handled in the initially generated code.
go/api*.go

# Do not overwrite README documentation
README.md
