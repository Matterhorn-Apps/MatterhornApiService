# OpenAPI Generator Ignore
# Generated by openapi-generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator

# Use this file to prevent files from being overwritten by the generator.
# The patterns follow closely to .gitignore or .dockerignore.

# Do not overwrite entry point
main.go

# Do not overwrite dependency definitions in go.mod
go.mod

# Do not overwrite service implementation files
go/*_service.go

# Do not regenerate api_counters.go
# There is a bug in the go-server generator that causes unused imports to be included for services that
# define operations without any request parameters or objects, necessitating that we run gofmt manually
# on such files before the build will succeed.
# This is an unusual case that is only present here because we have created a very simple prototype endpoint;
# we just won't regenerate it to avoid the problem.
go/api_counters.go

# Do not overwrite README documentation
README.md
